In the last couple of weeks, Frank Fischer (GCDH), Mathias Göbel (SUB), Dario Kampkaspar (HAB Wolfenbüttel) and me sat down to toy with our data. We reworked and corrected a bunch of theatre pieces from the TextGrid Repository and added them to our corpus, generated new visualisations and compiled some new statistics:

Our forst round of results will be presented on two upcoming conferences, stay tuned.
