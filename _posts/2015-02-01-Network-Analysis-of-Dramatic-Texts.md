In the last couple of weeks, Frank Fischer (GCDH), Mathias Göbel (SUB), Dario Kampkaspar (HAB Wolfenbüttel) and me sat down to reshape the whole project, "Network Analysis of Dramatic Texts". We reworked and corrected a bunch of theatre pieces from the [TextGrid Repository](https://textgridrep.de/) and added them to our corpus, compiled some new statistics and generated new visualisations:

Our first round of results will be presented at two upcoming conferences, in [Graz](/DHd-2015-Conference-in-Graz/) and [Munich](/Conference_in_Munich/). See you there!
