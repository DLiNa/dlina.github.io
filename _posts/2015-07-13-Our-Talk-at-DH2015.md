Our Talk at DH2015 in Sydney (Full Text)

That's right, we transcribed the talk we gave at the DH2015 in Sydney, on 2 July 2015, titled "Digital Network Analysis of Dramatic Texts". We were the last team to speak in a very interesting network-analysis centric session chaired by [Glenn Roe](https://twitter.com/glennhroe). If you look very clooosely (here) at this panorama pic, you will recognise us setting up the room together with the other speakers, [Elisa Beshero-Bondar](https://twitter.com/epyllia) and [Ryan Heuser](https://twitter.com/quadrismegistus):

Anyway, since we used [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) as presentation framework, we can easily reference individual slides so you can follow both our transcript and the slides simultaneously. Our abstract is [here](http://dh2015.org/abstracts/xml/FISCHER_Frank_Digital_Network_Analysis_of_Dramati/FISCHER_Frank_Digital_Network_Analysis_of_Dramatic_Text.html). The full presentation is [here](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html). Let's start the show:

**Slide 0/0: [Title](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html)**

**Slide 1/0: [TOC](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/1)**

## 1. Approach

**Slide 2/0: [Basic Ideas](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/2)**

The tradition of structural approaches in literary studies reaches back at least to the different european structuralisms, which have been under development since the 1960s. Our project continues this tradition, but now uses automated data analysis to identify and characterize structural features of literary texts, or more precisely: of dramatic texts. In short, the long-term objective of our project is to gather and provide structural data which can be used, for example, to describe different compositional types of plays What we mean by compositional types, or rather types of structural composition, is best illustrated by an example – precisely: by two examples.

**Slide 2/1: [Different Styles of Structural Composition](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/2/1)**

Let’s have a look at two network graphs that have been generated during our data analysis. The graph on the left visualises the scenic interactions between characters in Goethes 1787 neo-classical play Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), which is influenced by an Aristotelian poetics. The graph on the right side visualises the interactions in a work also written by Goethe, the history play Götz von Berlichingen, which on the other hand is strongly influenced by a Shakespearian poetics. We don’t want to discuss this in detail. But even at first glance you can see, that these texts have a very different structure. They are composed in very different ways. They are, so to say, shaped by two very different types of structural or compositional style.

**Slide 2/2: [The Digital Spectator](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/2/2)**

In our project we are looking into these structural styles in the history of dramatic texts. We do this, as said, in the tradition of stucturalistic approaches, and we combine these approaches with methods that were devoloped in social network analysis – as done by several scholars since the early 21th century, for example, de Nooy, Rydberg-Cox or Moretti, to name but a few. From social network analysis we take our specific definition of structure, which means: the structure of a dramatic text, which we are analyzing, is the interaction between characters in a play. To put it more precisely: A relation between two characters, as we define it, is given if both characters are performing a speech act in a given segment of a play, generally this is a scene. So if character A and character B are speaking in a scene, they are – following our definition – linked to each other.

By the way, this definition is inspired by the work of romanian scholar Solomon Marcus. In his intriguing 1973 study called Mathematical Poetics Marcus suggested a concept which one might call the digital spectator. This fits our definition very well, because we are simulating a digital spectator, as it were, who is, however, not looking at a performative realization of a play, but at an XML file.
By means of said definition of interaction we are collecting our data; we are calculating network measures, generating graphs, running statistics and doing some other stuff of quantitative analysis.

**Slide 2/3: [465 Network Graphs](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/2/3)**

And we are doing this, at this time, on a corpus of 465 german language plays – which you can see here. By the way: you can download this fancy poster from figshare.
We are planning to include other periods in our analysis, and we will, in the future, include other language plays. But at this time, our focus is on german plays.

**Slide 2/4: [Workflow](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/2/4)**

In the following minutes we will present our workflow to you, which means, we will talk about three steps: data mining, data editing and the display and analysis of our data.

## 2. Data Mining

**Slide 3/0: [Corpus](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/3)**

What makes our analysis quite difficult is that we are dealing with, so to say, dirty data. If you have TEI-documents like, for example, the ones in the Folger Library Shakespeare corpus, it’s easy to do the structural analysis we want to do. But this well-tagged TEI is very rare. Usually, we are quite deligthed if we have a digitized text, often only with some rudimentary tagging. This is the case for German literature corpora. Although we have a quite large and freely available corpus of German literature (ranging from around 1500 to the 1930s), called the TextGridReposity, this corpus was tagged automatically, which leads not only to a quite rudimentary TEI tagging but also to lots of tagging-errors. If this is the case, there are basically two options: you may initiate a several million euro project, that over many years improves all the TEI-tagging; or you try to adress the corpus under a specific focus, trying to extract and improve specific data. Lacking several million euros, we took the second way.

As said above, our first decision was to concentrate on specific structural data. This also means that we concentrate on a specific literary genre: theatre plays or, in general, dramatic texts. Thus, in a first step, we had to extract all dramatic texts from the TextGridRepository. That might sound relatively easy, but is’s not. We wrote a long blogpost about this task, but to address the results directly: At the end of this step we had extracted 666 dramatic texts in rudimentarily TEI tagged XML documents.

**Slide 3/1: [DLINA Corpus 15.07 ("Codename Sydney")](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/3/1)**

Out of this coprus, we built our so called "DLINA Corpus 15.7 (Codename: Sydney)". This corpus comprises 465 dramatic texts, which means that we discarded some 200 files . There were some reasons for excluding texts from our corpus. First, we wanted to limit our research to a specific time span, beginning with the modernisation of German drama in the outset of the enligthment, which means – following a well-established academic position – to start with the work of Johann Christoph Gottsched in the 1730 years. Furthermore, we ruled out, inter alia, foreign-language play, translations, mere pantomime plays, fragments; and we sorted out a few text with very defective TEI markup. So all in all, our Sydney corpus compromises 465 dramatic texts in german language ranging, exactly, from 1731 to 1929.

But this was just our starting point. What came next and what turned out to be a major task, was the data editing.

## 3. Data Editing

**Slide 4: [Extracting Structural Data](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/4)**

As mentioned above, the TEI-markup in the TextGridRep-data was quite rudimentary – and often faulty. So we had to find a way to edit and improve the data. Because we are just interested in a specific kind of structural data, we decided not to regularly edit the original XML files but to selectively extract those data we are interested in, and then just edit these specific data. This was the moment in which we invented what we call the "DLINA zwischenformat", which roughly translates as ‚DLINA intermediary format‘ or simply ‚DLINA data file’. This intermediary format can be considered a structural abstraction of the fulltext TEI documents in our corpus. It is an XML file which is validated against [a specific RNG schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlina/project/master/rules/lina.rnc). A *zwischenformat* file is created for each drama. It stores metadata, the actual structural data, and documentation (optional).

The structural data stored are the acts and scenes, the speakers occurring in the respective segments, and optionally some amounts, e.g., the number of speech acts, words, etc. for these characters. This DLINA data file not only makes improving the data quality easier but it also allows for a relatively quick way of gathering new data by basically just writing down the structure of a play and the speakers in the segments.
You may have a look at our Blogpost that introduces the DLINA intermediary format. Or maybe you like to explore all the 465 DLINA files which we generated from our corpus and which are stored on GitHub.

**Slide 4/1: [Editing Process](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/4/1)**

However, just generating the DLINA data files was not enough. This is because the raw DLINa data files still retained some of the dirty data from the original XMLs - it was, in other words, full of bugs. So manual intervention was often necessary to improve the data quality and correct errors in the source data.

In this editing process we had to face some errors that were due to automated conversion to TEI of the TextGrid-Files; and we had to face some, so to say, intrinsic problems, i.e. characteristics typical for a play.

One recurrent problem of the first group:
* there were OCR errors in the `<speaker>` name

A phenomenon, that results from intrinsic characteristics of the play and that we had do face is
* that there are different ways of refer to a character.

For example, a character's full name might be given on the first appearance and only the first name on further appearances. In this case, we had to manually identify both names to one character.

There were a lot more problems we hade to solve while editing the DLINA intermediary format; for most of problems we established editing rules, you can read a complete documentation including editing examples on our Blog.

**Slide 4/2: [Outlook](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/4/2)**

And we will further improve our editing process. At this time, for example, we are devolping a GUI for some of the more simple editing procedures. This GUI will also include some gamification elements, so maybe we will have some crowd-editing-option in the future.

## 4. Display and Analysis

**Slide 5/0: [Four Types of Visualisation](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/5)**

After editing and cleaning our 465 data files, we did two things: we started to publish our data and commented on it in larger blog posts, and we ran some statistics, also with detailed comments. As we stressed before and can’t stress enough, this project is still very much a work in progress, but we can and we will show you some promising first results.
As mentioned before, all our data is stored on our GitHub, and therefore very transparent. On top of that, we built a small network-data publishing machine to provide easy access to our data. We created a homepage for every of the 465 plays. There is a list of all these plays if you click on this link.
On each of the homepages you’ll find 4 links leading to further information on the particular play.

**Slide 5/1: [Example: G. E. Lessing's "Emilia Galotti" (1772)](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/5/1)**

One of the pages shows the network graph, with lines between all the people speaking in the same segment. There is a static graph and one with sticky nodes. Another page shows a matrix of encounters. And there is a page where you can have a look at our intermediary source file. That’s our data in plain daylight! Eventually, there is one page that contains a bar chart with word counts for each character of the play. You can also interactively sort them.

Slide 5/2: [Skit (The Biggest Chatterboxes in German Literature)](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/5/2)**

Which brings me to a little skit, a little interlude. With the kind of data we gathered, it was easy for us to make a list of the biggest chatterboxes in German literature, of course, only based on our middle-sized corpus. And for all of you who didn’t do their German Literature 101: it doesn’t matter, I’m sure you will at least know Faust and his counterpart Mephistopheles, from Goethe’s play “Faust, part 1”. And both of them are very talkative, earning places 3 and 4 of this top-10 of the biggest chatterboxes in German literature. Again, there’s a blog post on the subject, but of course, this one is a bit “tongue-in-cheek” and not part of our actual research.

Let’s rather have a look at some more meaningful facts. We actually started out to process our data by means of Social Network Analysis. Again, our measures are currently very basic, for example, we’re computing the size of our drama networks, their density, their average degree and so on. For now, let us acquaint you with just two charts we’re currently discussing in the group and with other colleagues.

**Slide 5/3: [Network Size (Median) by Decade (1730–1930)](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/5/3)

Here you can see the evolution of network sizes between 1730 and 1930, our two focal centuries. On the x-axis you can see the 20 decades. The y-axis features the median values of the number of characters of all the plays of a decade.

Let’s now try some cautious interpretation of this diagram. Something is happening there, that’s for sure, but what exactly? Well, some of the ups and downs we did expect. Like for example: The increase of this value in the second half of the 18th century might be associated with the beginning reception of Shakespeare in Germany, which lead, among other things, to the rise of the Historical Play in German literature. Or, another quick glimpse, the dropping values at the end of the 19th century might be associated with the rise of the Naturalistic Drama, which – to make a long story short – returned to the ideas of something like a Aristotelian poetics.

We published many more charts on our website, we also started to discuss them there, and this process will continue, of course. If you like, please have a look – and join the discussion. For now, we just show you one last chart, one that introduces another idea we will address with our statistical approaches. I’m talking about concepts of genre, or rather: subgenre.

Slide 5/4: [Network Density (Mean) by Genre and Century](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/5/4)**

While editing our intermediary files we also included basic genre data, with the main focus on the usual suspects, major genres like tragedy, comedy, and opera libretti. With this kind of genre data we could now build subcorpora to have a look at genres and their specific network measures.

And we immediately noticed some interesting things. What we can see here is a multiple-line chart featuring the arithmetic means of density values by genre and century. Just looking at this single value over time, we can conclude that comedies and libretti implement a very similiar structural composition over the centuries, while character networks of tragedies (the lowermost line in our diagram) show a much lower density. What is more, the values shown are pretty consistent over the centuries. This might be a first indication that we could actually cluster genres of dramatic texts by just looking at a few basic measures.

But as stated before, this is all very basic data. What we have right now is a plethora of network data and we’re starting to look into them. But we should not run to conclusions too fast. It is still a long way to integrate our network analysis of dramatic texts into a holistic study of literary evolution. We will be pushing out more data on our blog in the next few months. For example, we’re putting the finishing touches on an article on Network Values by Genre, should be ready in a week or two.

## 5. Further Research

**Slide 6/0: [Yada Yada](https://dlina.github.io/presentations/2015-sydney/sydney.html#/6)**

Wrapping things up, here is a slide with some notes on further research ideas. We need more statistical data, and we need to interpret them thoroughly. In addition, we will enlarge our German-language corpus. We will also look into existing foreign-language corpora which also opens up the field of comparative studies. I’m especially thinking of Paul Fièvre’s excellent corpus comprising more than 750 French plays, but we will also be looking into a collection of American drama and we’re also happy to cooperate with other scholars on the subject.
But our first and foremost task will be to find ways to contribute to traditional Literary Studies, to evaluate existing hypotheses reached by close-reading approaches, by traditional means, so to speak. Plus, we will try to reach an own set of interpretations and hold them against established hypotheses in the field of Literary Studies. That is and should be our long-term plan at least.
