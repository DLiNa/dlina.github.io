The network analysis of literary texts rests on a number of algorithmic
foundations, which are often not sufficiently reflected in the field. In
this regard, one problematic case is the existence of detached subgraphs.
Here's a classic example, the network of Goethe's *Faust, Part One* (1808),
visualised with our online tool [**ezlinavis**](https://dlina.github.io/ezlinavis/)
(*Faust* being one of the examples you can select from the pull-down menu
in the right upper corner):

</figure>

We can visually distinguish three subgraphs:

* the main graph revolving around Faust and Mephisto, which basically
comprises the entire plot of the play, except for two detached single scenes:
  * Vorspiel auf dem Theater (Prelude in the Theater)
  * Walpurgisnachtstraum (Walpurgis Night's Dream)

The two latter scenes do not feature any character from the main graph, which is
problematic when starting to calculate network metrics. For example, if we want
to calculate the [average path length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length),
which is the average distance from one node to all other nodes, how long is the distance
between, say, Faust and any of the characters in the detached Walpurgis Night's Dream?
**It is, well, infinite.** If we still want to calculate things like the average
distance, we can do that, we just have to find a way to deal with unconnected
pairs of nodes. In any case: "Computing the average distance in disconnected
graphs needs careful consideration."
([Zweig 2016, p.Â 223](https://books.google.com/books?id=MpNjDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA223)).

There are different ways to implement this, and even if you're just using
network tools out of the box, you should be aware of the kind of algorithm
that is used to calculate network metrics in unconnected graphs.

One way is to only consider the paths that actually exist and neglect all
other pairs of nodes. If we use that option, the results for six selected
characters from *Faust, Part One* are such:

| Character      | Degree | Average Distance | Closeness Centrality |
|----------------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Faust          | 55     | 1.11             | 0.90                 |
| Mephistopheles | 35     | 1.44             | 0.70                 |
| Wagner         | 25     | 1.71             | 0.58                 |
| Margarete      | 9      | 1.85             | 0.54                 |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |
| Weltkind       | 35     | 1.0              | 1.0                  |
| Sternschnuppe  | 35     | 1.0              | 1.0                  |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |

This actually makes sense. Characters/speakers in Walpurgis Night's Dream
(represented by Weltkind and Sternschnuppe) are not interacting directly with
characters in other scenes and "stay among themselves", so to speak, which is
why they all have an average distance of 1.0. â€“ Yet if it is true that the
central character, the protagonist if you will, is "the character that minimize[s]
the sum of the distances to all other vertices" ([Alberich/Miro-Julia/RossellÃ³
2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202174v1)), we have a problem, because
**Faust stops being the protagonist of *Faust***, overrun by the 36 speakers of
the Walpurgis Night's Dream. In other words: **Goethe's Walpurgis Night's Dream,
in regard of network theory, is a [link farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm).**

If we still want network metrics to be meaningful when it comes to determining
who the central character of a play could be, we better rely on a different
option. For practical reasons, the distance between two unconnected nodes is
sometimes declared as length of the longest existing path, plus one. If we use
this method to assume an (artificial) distance for every pair of nodes, the
above table would look like this:

| Character      | Degree | Average Distance | Closeness Centrality |
|----------------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Faust          | 55     | 1.81             | 0.55                 |
| Mephistopheles | 35     | 2.33             | 0.42                 |
| Wagner         | 25     | 2.78             | 0.35                 |
| Margarete      | 9      | 3.02             | 0.33                 |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |
| Weltkind       | 35     | 2.88             | 0.34                 |
| Sternschnuppe  | 35     | 2.88             | 0.34                 |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |

And â€¦ **Faust is back!** Shortest average distance! â€“ For our upcoming paper
on the different kinds of extracting protagonists in plays, we are using this
method to calculate average distances. But, having said that, it cannot be
emphasised enough that since the concept of the protagonist is such a rich
concept, we should not try to use but one simple measure to automatically
determine such entities. Which is something we'll address in said paper, stay
tuned. ðŸ˜Š

Ok, let's consider one last way to calculate distance values between unconnected
networks. E.g., when we used **igraph** as network library (before switching to
**networkx**), we saw results that were totally different, because we used a
fallback that determined that
["the length of the missing paths are counted having length ```vcount(graph)```, one longer than the longest possible geodesic in the network"](http://igraph.org/r/doc/distances.html)
(i.e., **vcount** being the number of vertices of a graph). The resulting metrics,
although calculated correctly, don't make much sense:

| Character      | Degree | Average Distance | Closeness Centrality |
|----------------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Faust          | 55     | 40.07            | 0.02                 |
| Mephistopheles | 35     | 40.27            | 0.02                 |
| Wagner         | 25     | 40.44            | 0.02                 |
| Margarete      | 9      | 40.52            | 0.02                 |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |
| Weltkind       | 35     | 67.0             | 0.01                 |
| Sternschnuppe  | 35     | 67.0             | 0.01                 |
| â€¦              | â€¦      | â€¦                | â€¦                    |

In this approach, the assumed paths when bridging the infinite distance between
two subgraphs are much longer than with the previous algorithms. The differences
in the average distances only become visible after the decimal point. This
approach might make sense in some contexts, but not in our case.

All told, our maxim really has to be, and not only when confronted with
subgraphs: **Know your implementation!**
