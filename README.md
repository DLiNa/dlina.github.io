# DLINA -  Website Repo
based on the outstanding service by github pages and Jekyll! 

If you are interested in the dlina content, have a look at the rendered [website](https://dlina.github.io).


Since the pages grows up and contains more than 2,300 static pages the rendering time increased. On Linux use quick-deb.sh that prepares a reduced version by omiting most of the lina related sites and starts Jekyll on localhost. `./quick-deb.sh remote` starts with a new clone, standard method `./quick-deb.sh` includes local changes.
