This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

In the\n              <strong> left column</strong>, you can list segments (chapters,\n              acts, scenes, etc.) and characters appearing or speaking in a\n              given segment. Segments are indicated with a hashtag and they can\n              be hierarchical, e.g.:\n            </p>\n            <pre>{`# First Act\\n## First Scene\\n### …`}</pre>\n            <p>\n              This will automatically generate a CSV file with node-node\n              relations (source, type, target, weight) in the <strong>column in\n              the centre</strong>. Data changes as you type: as soon as you\n              change something in the first column, the mid-column changes\n              accordingly. The &quot;type&quot; column in the CSV file is always\n              &quot;undirected&quot; here, but we inserted it so you can\n              directly work with the CSV files in Gephi. The network graph in\n              the right column is also generated live, using a spring-embedded\n              layout, just to give you a first impression of what your network\n              data looks like. To make it easier to understand how ezlinavis\n              works, we provide some example files which can be accessed via the\n              drop-down menu in the first column.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <em>ezlinavis</em> was developed by Carsten Milling and Frank\n              Fischer, making use of the React and Sigma JS libraries.

The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function.
